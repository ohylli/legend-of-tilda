# Legend of Tilda

## About

Legend of Tilda is a silly proof-of-concept platformer game created as an experiment with AI tools. This project was born out of a fun collaboration between friends, showcasing what can be accomplished in just a couple of hours using various AI technologies.

## Play the Game

You can play the game here: [Legend of Tilda](https://ohylli.github.io/legend-of-tilda/)

## How It Was Made

- **Game Code & Dog Sprite**: Generated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model by Anthropic.
- **Background Music**: Created with Udio, an AI music generation tool.
- **Jumping/Barking Sound Effect**: Generated using ElevenLabs AI sound effect generator.

## Game Controls

- **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **Right Arrow**: Move right
- **Up Arrow**: Jump (and bark!)

## Known Issues

Due to browser autoplay policies, the background music and sound effects may not play automatically when you first load the game. If you don't hear any audio, try clicking anywhere on the game screen to enable sound.

## A Note on This README

In keeping with the spirit of this AI-driven project, this README was also written by an AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). Because who writes their own documentation these days, right?

Enjoy playing Legend of Tilda, and may your AI adventures be ever fruitful!
